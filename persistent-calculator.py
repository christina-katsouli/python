# Similar to the last exercise where we built a calculator, users will be able to input what type of mathematical operation they want to perform.
# However, now, before we begin the code we will ask them to input a number (let's call it x). This number will be modified throughout the running.

# Then we will open a loop (while True:) -> Every iteration of the loop we will prompt the user to input how they would like to modify x
# (e.g add y, multiply by y, subtract y from x, divide by y) -> then update x in place, so we can keep looping and modify it

# Enjoy coding ðŸ˜˜ I love you
